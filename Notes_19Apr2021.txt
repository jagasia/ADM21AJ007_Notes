Topics to discuss now till 9:42
----------------------------------
HTML + Javascript
	truyum	(if you are able to sove that case study, it is evident you have learnt javascript to some extent)


it is possible to create a file with extension "js"
	jag.js

this file is a javascript file
	this file can contain lot of js code, functions, variables, etc
	usually we can write javascript code inside functions

we write js code inside	
1) <script> tag in head of HTML
2) <script> tag in body of HTML
3) external .js file

head:
	if you write js code in head, it is loaded even before the page is displayed
	
body:
	if you write js code in body, then understand it is top-down approach
	the code declared below is not available for code above

	.....	cannot use "i" here. similarly, a function declared/ defined below is not available in the top
	....
	...
	var i;

external:
	js file is very useful when javascript code is written by someone else, and html is done by someone else

if i code js code inside a function,
then i have to call the function. only then the function is executed

<script>
	alert('hi');
</script>

here, the code is not inside any function. then on loading the page, it is executed

even before the page is displayed, the alert message is seen displayed


----------------
whenever we create a project.
a project is a folder

all files
	images
	css files
	js files
	html files

all must be present 
	directly or
	in sub folders INSIDE the project folder only

	DO NOT REFER TO IMAGES OUTSIDE PROJECT FOLDER

--------------------------------
programming constructs
	if-else
	switch-case
	while
	for

	arrays
	objects
	JSON




they gave HTML code
	<p class="abcd">

	<p id="efgh">


you have to write CSS code for that

	<p class="abcd">

	css selectors
		1) element selector
		2) ID selector
		3) class selector
		4) pseudo selector

class 		.
id		#
element		no symbol

.abcd			this means any element whose class is "abcd"
{
}

p.abcd			this memans any paragraph whose class is "abcd"
{
}




some people "suppose they dont knwo the symbol for class", they change the html code and finally they solve the problem.
But marks are not given. Because the skeleton is changed



----------------
var x=20;

the variable x is a numeric variable now.	This is based on the value entered
x='rama';
	the variable x become a string variable now

x=new Date();
	the variable x become a date object now


Activity:
	identify various data types in jav
ascript language



1) undefined				var x;
2) numeric
3) string
4) Date
5) boolean				true or false
6) arrays
7) objects
			var person = {firstName:"John", lastName:"Doe", age:50, eyeColor:"blue"};



 if (10 > 25)
            console.log('ok');
        else
            console.log('not ok')


if(true)
{
}
else
{
}

when there is only 1 line inside true or else part, then no need of {}

if(true)
	,,,,,
else if(condition)
	......
else
	......
&&
||
for multiple conditions

true && true		true



if(x=='ECE')

if(x=='EEE')

consider using switch case


OPERATORS:
	
+
-
*
/
%
++
--
&&
||

=		is for assigning value to the variable
==		is for checking if both operands are equal
===		is for checking if both operands are same		(same means? value, type all are same)


1) datatypes in javascript
2) operators in javascript
3) programming constructs


when i define a customer
	customerId	"C001"
	firstName	"Rama"
	lastName	"Krishna"
	




an object in javascript has 
	properties
		key-value pair



array of objects
	[{},{},{}]


use [] for arrays

{} for object



JSON
	JavaScript Object Notation

an object in javascript is displayed in JSON 
	{key:value}



String to object		JSON.parse
object to string		JSON.stringify



in javascript we can store some information in 
	localStorage		(or)
	sessionStorage	

sessionStorage is alive only as long as the browser is open. Once closed, it will be destroyed

localStorage is available permanently even if the computer is shutdown, next day also we can see the value


Have you seen a login form having

	"Remember Me" option?		(check box)?



localStorage is very easy to store some information in a computer.
	if we login from another computer, this information is not available


localStorage
	setItem		store the data in the computer
	getItem		retrieve data
	removeItem	remove that item


setItem(key,value)

value=getItem(key);

removeItem(key);			//removes the items whose name is given as argument




javascript is running in the client's computer

if we access "facebook" from this computer, then this computer is a client to facebook. Program comes from server. but some programs run in client and some programs run in server (and their output is sent to client)




a=b;			what happens here?

I WANT only 2 digits precision
Math.round() converts decimal floating number into INTEGER only	(NO OPTION FOR HOW MANY DIGITS)

if we need 2 digits precision ,	MULTIPLY BY 100 and ROUND it. then divide by 100

EMI*=100;
EMI=Math.round(EMI);
EMI/=100;
alert(EMI);
