Maven
	in command line

mvn -Dabcd	-Defgh	-Dsomething
mvn clean install			this will build the application compile, check for errors


i deleted this mvn when i use 
	right click project
		run as
			maven build
				goals

mv goals


we do projects in our computer	(source computer)

upload the project to server	(target computer)


in server, we can build the application

	we change something in some of the files after upload
	we dont have eclipse in server
	so how we compile the changes done?

in cmd prompt

1) create a maven project in cmd prompt itself?

what are the details we need to tell in that command?
i need to specify 
	the project name
	the arche type
	group id
	artifact id
	package name

to create a simple maven project:-

mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.companyname.projectname  -DartifactId=simple-maven-project  -Dpackage=com.companyname.projectname  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT



mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.cts.hospital  -DartifactId=simple-maven-project  -Dpackage=com.cts.hospital  -Dversion=1.0-SNAPSHOT



mvn pmd:pmd

	PMD stands for Program Mistake Detector
