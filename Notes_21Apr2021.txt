insert

these commands are required for TekStac hands on

tHESE commands come under the category
	DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE	(DML)

1) INSERT
----------
	Insert statement is used to add row(s) into the table
2) UPDATE
----------
	Update statement is used to update the existing record(s) in the table
3) DELETE
----------
	Delete statement is used to delete the existing record(s) in the table

DROP is used to remove a TABLE in the database (totally different from DELETE)

INSERT:
-------
	Syntax of INSERT

	INSERT INTO <<TABLENAME>> (<<COL LIST>>) VALUES (<<VALUE LIST>>);

Ex:
	INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE (ASSOCIATEID, COHORTCODE, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME, MOBILENO) VALUE (123456, 'AJ007', 'RAMESH', 'KUMAR', '9898989898');



select * from associate;

specify only the required columns whose values are provided
INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE (ASSOCIATEID, FIRSTNAME) VALUES (123457,'Siva');

provide columns in different order
INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE (FIRSTNAME,ASSOCIATEID) VALUES ('Kumar',123458);

INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE VALUES ();		//NOTICE THAT COLUMN LIST IS NOT PROVIDED
	In this case, we are supposed to provide all the values in the correct order.
	suppose, there are 5 columns in the table, we are supposed to provide 5 values in the correct order as in the table

INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE VALUES (123459, 'AJ007', 'SURESH', 'KUMAR', '9797979797');

Sometimes, we do not want to give values for few columns

INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE VALUES (123460, 'AJ007', 'Prakash', 'KUMAR', null);

we can provide 
	NULL		(no value is provided)
	DEFAULT		(some columns might be defined with DEFAULT values, we mention DEFAULT)
	in those places

ex:
	country is a column. for which default value is 'India'. it is defined in the create table statement


when the data type is simple character / number it is easy.

but if the data type is date?
	what is the format for date?
		yyyy-MM-dd			this is the format in which we have to give the date value
	note that MM is capital. mm is minutes

INSERT INTO trandetails VALUES('T00013','A00002','2021-04-21','Cheque','Deposit',1000);




so far, we have seen insert statements that add only 1 row into the table

we can also use this insert statement to add multiple rows into the table

INSERT INTO associate VALUES 
(123461,'AJ007','Jagadees','waran','919329393'),
(123462,'AJ007','Raja','sivakumar','939393933');


CREATE TABLE `associate_copy` (
  `ASSOCIATEID` int(11) DEFAULT NULL,
  `COHORTCODE` char(10) DEFAULT NULL,
  `FIRSTNAME` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `LASTNAME` varchar(50) DEFAULT NULL,
  `MOBILENO` char(10) DEFAULT NULL
);


INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE_COPY 
SELECT * FROM ASSOCIATE;

	THE Above insert statement adds all records produced by the SELECT query into a table. (multi row insert)

1) REGULAR INSERT STATEMENT
	ALL COLUMNS IN CORRECT ORDER
2) SPECIFY SOME COLUMNS AND ADD A ROW
3) MULTI ROW INSERT STATEMENT 
		INSERT INTO associate VALUES 
		(123461,'AJ007','Jagadees','waran','919329393'),
		(123462,'AJ007','Raja','sivakumar','939393933');
4) MULTI ROW INSERT STATEMENT
		INSERT INTO ASSOCIATE_COPY 
		SELECT * FROM ASSOCIATE;




-----------------------------------
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF "SELECT" Statement
	when we want to retrieve data from the table(s)

	SELECT * FROM ASSOCIATE;
		this query retrieves all columns (* means all columns) from the associate table.
		how many rows? all rows? yes all rows, because, there is no condition provided

	SELECT * FROM <<TABLENAME>>		


IN PROBLEM #2, THEY DO NOT WANT TO SEE ALL COLUMNS OF DEPARTMENT. They want to see only the department_name 

	so instead of * we have to use column name(s)

In Problem #2, they do not want to see all rows, they want to see only the deparment name where block no is something
	so we have to use condition.
	"WHERE" is used to give condition

select associateid, firstname, lastname 
from associate 
where firstname='Siva';


where clause is used to do "selection"
column list is used to do "projection"




we have to write SELECT queries using JOINS
-------------------------------------------
1 or 2 problems are based on UPDATE and DELETE

update statement is used to update the existing records (rows)
	
	UPDATE ASSOCIATE SET COHORTCODE='AJ007' WHERE ASSOCIATEID=123457;

	If i do not give condition (WHERE)
		THEN ALL THE ROWS WILL BE UPDATED WITH COHORTCODE 'AJ007'

whenever you do 
	UPDATE
	DELETE
remember to check the condition we use in where clause.

the condition is based on a primary key column, means, only 1 row will be updated.
because, primary key column values are unique. it is more preferrable to give condition based on primary key,

but in tekstac, they will give the condition (indirectly) using instructions

so you have to use the problem description to find the condition to be used



UPDATE ASSOCIATE SET LAstname='waran' WHERE ASSOCIATEID=123458 OR ASSOCIATEID=123457;

update associate set lastname='waran' where associateid in (123456, 123459)


in above queries i have used operators like
	OR
	IN
	BETWEEN
	NOT IN
	NOT BETWEEN
	AND
	


=====================
SELECT query:
--------------
	SELECT COLUMNLIST 
	FROM TABLENAME(S)
	ORDER BY
	GROUP BY
	HAVING
	

sub queries
and 
joins



coalesce()
	is a function that can accept any number of arguments
	the first not null arg is returned

	coalesce(aadhar, pan, passport, voter, license)
		the first not null arg found, is returned by the function. if everything is null, null is returned
