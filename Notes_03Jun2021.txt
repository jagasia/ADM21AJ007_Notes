Code quality
	PMD		Program Mistake Detector
	Sonar
		SonarQube	analyse the project and give you the findings

				Bug, code smell, cost


in cmd prompt
	mvn -version

i) M2, 		M2_HOME		these env variables are set
ii) JAVA_HOME			set to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281			(not bin)

command "mvn" will work

in eclipse, we right click project, run as maven build		we set some goals
	those goals can be executed in cmd prompt using
		mvn command

	ex:
		mvn clean install

we can also create a maven project in cmd prompt:
	specify
		archetype
		group id
		artifact id
	etc
		using -D switch





Introduction to application servers (Tomcat)

when i created a website 
	HTML

i uploaded in web server

	easy to create html pages and upload them into the web server.

when they asked me to create a form with submit

application form that people can fill data and submit

Servlets
JSP





java program that stores data in the database		YOU KNOW
java program that retrieves data from the database	YOU KNOW


HTML
Java
RDBMS SQL


what is the gap?

connecting HTML to Java
	this is where 
		Servlet
		JSP

myservlet is going to be an alias for MyServlet.java

Servlets

JSP
	Java Server Pages
JSTL
	JSP Standard Tag Library



Applets
	are java programs that run in browser

Javascript has overtaken this applet

Javascript programs come under the category called as "Client side" scripts.

Servlets are also java programs that come under the category called as "Server side" scripts.

but in javascript, why am i not able to access database?
	because, javascript program runs in the client.

now, you want to know what is 
	client
	server

I am accessing Facebook.com from this computer
	now this computer is called as "client"
	the pages comes from a remote computer called as "server"

Server
	stores all the web pages

Client
	is a computer where browser is used to access the website

if i write a program to display time:
	which time will be displayed?
		client's time? or server's time?

	var dt=new Date();		//system time is automatically loaded		(new)
					//which system?		
					Java script runs in client computer. So client's time is displayed by js

if write the same code in Servlet
	Date dt=new Date();		//servlet.
					//server's time is stored n dt.		because, this servlet program runs in server

Since, servlets run in server, they can access database. 
	because, database is not present in client. they are present in server

do you think the pictures you upload in facebook are present in every computer you access?
	no they are stored only in the server	( in db )


Server and Client is very clear now

what is a server?
	Server is a computer that allows us to upload our webpages. So that people from anywhere in the world, use internet to access those web pages.

Web Server
	simply stores web pages
	Ex:
		Personal Web Server
		Peer Web Server

Web Application Server		(shortly called as App Server)
	stores web pages
	also allows programs to run and produce output			(runtime environment)

	Ex:
		Apache Tomcat Server		(we use this)
		JBoss
		Weblogic
		WebSphere	IBM
		FrontPage Extension		for ASP.net		microsoft		(IIS)
		

Apache tomcat server
	free downloadable

	Apache tomcat server 9.0



Refactoring
-----------

	TDD
		Test Driven Development

		we follow:
			Fail
			Pass
			Refactor

	the test cases are available even before we do coding.

	test case for "sum"
		2, 3, 		5

	we write a program to fail, pass, then refactor

	Refactor means, modifying the structure of the program without affecting logic.


	main method:
		you did jdbc coding

	later:
		we refactored it into 
			Dao class

	
Project, Employee  and Project Allocation 

	Project	
	ProjectDAO			code to insert update delete select
	Employee
	EmployeeDAO

the relationship between these 2 entities is Many - Many

Hence we need a new entity to store the 

	Project Allocation
		eid
		pid



10 to 20
		A

21 to 30
		B

above 31
		C


if(x>=10 && x<=20)
{
		A
}
else if(x>=21 && x<=30)
{
		B
}
else if(x>=31 && x<=40)
{
		C
}




0 arg cons are commented
var names are meaningful
every if has else
	with curly braces
unused import statements are commented


	/*double bal=0;
		if(balance-amount > minimumBalance)
			return true;
		else
			return false;*/




		return balance-amount > minimumBalance;






	public Account viewAccountByAccountNumber(int accountNumber) {
		
		if(accountList.isEmpty()){
			return null;
		}
		else{
			for(Account a : accountList){
				if(a.getAccountNumber()==accountNumber){
					return a;
				}
			}
		return null;	
	}





	public Account viewAccountByAccountNumber(int accountNumber)
	{
		Account account=null;
		for(Account a : accountList)
		{
			if(a.getAccountNumber()==accountNumber)
			{
				account=a;
			}
		}
		return account;
	}
	



	public Account viewAccountByAccountNumber(int accountNumber)
	{		
		for(Account a : accountList)
		{
			if(a.getAccountNumber()==accountNumber)
			{
				return a;
			}
		}
		return null;
	}



	public List<Customer> viewAllCustomer(){
		if(customerList.isEmpty()){
			return null;
		}
		return customerList;		
	}




		public List<Customer> viewAllCustomer(){
			return (customerList.isEmpty())?return null:customerList;
		}




==============================
we will learn to 
	submit a html form to a servlet
	the servlet will be able to get the user inputs 
	the servlet can 
		compute
		calculate
		validate
		store data in db
		retrieve and return  the data to the browser


Servlet is a java program

	A class that extends HttpServlet 
		is a servlet

	GenericServlet
		is the super class for HttpServlet

	we are using HttpServlet

we will learn about life cycle of servlets, the container, alias, etc tomoro

today,
	we learn to do some mathematics operations using servlet

	<form action="MyServlet">
		Number 1: <input type=number name="no1" /><br/>
		Number 2: <input type=number name="no2" /><br/>
		<input type=submit />
	</form>



protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
		
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		int no1 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("no1"));
		int no2 = Integer.parseInt(request.getParameter("no2"));
		out.print(no1+no2);
	}
