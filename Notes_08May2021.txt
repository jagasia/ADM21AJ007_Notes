JDBC		Java DataBase Connectivity

why it is needed?
	whenever a java program has to access a database, 
	we need JDBC
what exactly it is?
	no need to install anything in addition 
	jdk is enough	(already there)
	just some packages
		java.sql
		javax.sql

	these packages contain lot of 
		interfaces
		classes
			methods	

	that can be used to do all operations in a database like
		SELECT
		INSERT
		UPDATE
		DELETE

	jdbc is consistent for most of the databases in the world like
		SQL Server	(Microsoft)
		Oracle		(Oracle)
		DB2		(IBM)
		MySql		(Oracle)

	we use mysql


		
1) lets connect to a mysql server from java program. What are the steps?
	i) load the driver		(we will discuss what is a driver)
	ii) URL	, UNAME, PASSWORD
	iii) get connection using the info given above
	iv) create an object representation of a SQL query
		Statement
		PreparedStatement
		CallableStatement
	v) execute the query 
		execute
		executeQuery
		executeUpdate
	vi) Result set
		loop the records from the beginning till end
	

WHat is driver?
	there are lot of RDBMS in this world. 
	They way they store data, or operate is definitely different.
	how can a java program instruct those RDBMS to store or retrieve data. IMPOSSIBLE

	So what java suggested the RDBMS vendors.
		These vendors should write java programs that can access their database.

	day before yesterday, we learnt to store data in the file using java program. So you know how objects can be stored in the database.

	Java language provides 
		some interfaces to the dbms vendors.
		vendors should provide the implementation of those interface

	ex:	the below are the interfaces provided by java language in JDBC API
		Connection interface
		Statement 
		PreparedStatement
		CallableStatement
		ResultSet

	lot of interfaces provided by jdbc. the implementations are provided by the dbms vendor like oracle corporation.

	Those java codes are compressed into "jar" file
	what is a jar file?
		java archive.		(Nothing much different from .rar	or 	.zip)
		.jar means compressed java project. means	a folder structure "src","bin" etc are followed

	
	Download the jar file from the rdbms vendor's website and use it in our project

	if we are using mysql db
		mysql-connector.jar 
	if we are using oracle db
		ojdbc
	
	etc etc 

	i am using 
		mysql-connector-java-5.1.47.jar


		Statement
			is used to execute simple queries which do not require parameters to be passed at runtime
			ex:		select * from Branch
					select * from Branch where bid="B00001"		//is also simple because, the condition has constant value. no variable whose value is bound and runtime
		PreparedStatement
			is used to execute parameterized queries. 
			ex:
					select * from Branch where bid=?
				//here, the value for that ? is given at runtime. so PreparedStatement
		CallableStatement
			is used to call "stored procedures" or "functions" that are present in the database.
			Mysql do not support plsql. So oracle can be used for this demo



		execute
		executeQuery
		executeUpdate
