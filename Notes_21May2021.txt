before doing your 1st hands on in tekstac
1) setter based injection
2) constructor based injection
3) autowiring
4) annotation configuration


in tekstac,
	maven project is already created. with pom.xml already configured. 
	"bean.xml" is named as "applicationContext.xml"
	AND THE NAMESPACES are already there. 
		we just need to configure the beans


in our yesterday's project,
	we use dependency injection
		Department	has List<EMployees>
		that was "setter" based injection

	how spring IOC container, created our bean instances?
		it created using "no" arg constructor.	(HTATS y when you did not have a no arg cons, you got error)

		it created an object using no arg cons.
		and then used setter methods to inject the properties

Now, lets see
		"constructor" based injection



Autowiring
	using xml configuration			(byName		byType)
	using annotation
		Qualifier annotation to specify the choice of implementation

			@Autowired
			@Qualifier("sony")
			private Audio audio;
