1) spring boot mvc form validation

	form validation
	---------------
		entered data should comply with some rule
		ex:	
			email id should have @ . characters etc
			password should be atleast 6 characters 
			age >=18

		form validation is data entry validation
			NOT checking if password is correct according to the database	that's not validation

		
how to implement form validation in spring mvc project?
	yesterday, we used taglib		"form"
		<%@ taglib prefix="form" uri="http://www.springframework.org/tags/form"%>


this form tag library provides support for validation

	in yesterdays project lets introduce some validation rule

	1) Branch Id should be atleast 6 characters
for form validation
	i) add dependency in pom.xml

	ii) use annotations in entity class that defines the validation rule
	public class Branch {
		@Size(min = 6, max = 6, message = "Branch ID should be exactly 6 characters")
		private String bid;
		private String bname;
		private String bcity;

	iii) this is not client side validation. This validation is done by the controller only
		so in the controller method, 	we need to enforce validation using
		@Valid

		and check if there are any failures using BindingResult
